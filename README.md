# Object-recognition_using_ResNet50_CNN
ResNet50 is a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture that has gained popularity for its ability to handle complex image recognition tasks. ResNet50 is part of the ResNet family of models, known for introducing the concept of residual learning, which helps in training very deep networks by addressing the vanishing gradient problem.

In this project, the goal is to design and train a ResNet50 model to recognize and classify images into 10 different object classes. This involves setting up the ResNet50 architecture, training the model on a labeled dataset, and evaluating its performance on unseen data.

**Advantages of Using ResNet50 for Object Recognition**

**High Accuracy:** ResNet50 is known for its accuracy in image recognition tasks, making it suitable for distinguishing between multiple object classes with high precision.

**Deep Architecture: **The depth of ResNet50 allows it to learn complex features and patterns in images, which improves its ability to generalize to different object classes.

**Residual Connections:** The use of residual connections in ResNet50 helps in mitigating the vanishing gradient problem, enabling the training of very deep networks without performance degradation.

**Transfer Learning:** ResNet50 can be fine-tuned for specific tasks using pre-trained weights, which reduces training time and improves performance, especially when dealing with smaller datasets.

**Versatility:** ResNet50 is versatile and can be applied to a wide range of image classification tasks beyond the initial 10 classes, making it a robust choice for various applications.

**Strong Community Support:** ResNet50 is well-documented and supported by a large community, with many available resources, tutorials, and pre-trained models to help in implementation.

Training a ResNet50 model for object recognition enables the development of robust and accurate systems that can classify objects across multiple categories, making it highly valuable in fields such as computer vision, robotics, and automated systems.
